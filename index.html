  <p> <b>Travel nurses</b> can increase their salary based on the amount of experience they have and how many hours they are willing to work. As a traveler, some of the highest paid registered nurse jobs are in the least desirable areas in medically underserved communities. Travel nurses who want to earn $100k understand that where they work will influence their pay. The beauty of travel nursing is the ability to pick and choose assignments based on pay and location.</p>  
  <p> According to Zip Recruiter,( as of February 2023), the average travel nurse salary is $106,030 per year, and approximately $50.98 an hour, $2,039/week, or $8,835/month. Travel RN salaries currently range between $80,000 to $127,500, with top 10th percentile earners making $150,500 annually.</p>
