  <p> Travel nurses can increase their salary based on the amount of experience they have and how many hours they are willing to work. As a traveler, some of the highest paid registered nurse jobs are in the least desirable areas in medically underserved communities. Travel nurses who want to earn $100k understand that where they work will influence their pay.
